  <p>	By day, I run Admissions for General Assembly.
By night, I write & recite poetry.
Before bed, I read biographies.
At dawn, I run on the bike trail behind my house, down the street, around the corner, touch the pole & head back. How's that for some geography?
At noon, I usually eat an avocado
My favorite show isn't on HBO...it's on Showtime.
For pleasure, I interview interesting people.
And my favorite band may as well be the Beatles.
I've got an idea for this class that I'd like to test.
If it doesn't work out, at least you'll get to try some Bo's Best.</p>
